This folder contains three foundational documents related to the hdzme001d spectral bound for robust stability validation in uncertain linear systems:

1. spectral-bound-english.pdf  
   Published in 2025, this article presents a fast, algebraic spectral bound based on the Hermitian part of the nominal matrix and a structured norm deviation. Validated in over 30,000 simulations, it offers real-time applicability in embedded control, robotics, and energy systems.  
   DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17593139

2. spectral-bound-spanish.pdf  
   Spanish version of the article, adapted for regional dissemination and academic platforms in Latin America. It preserves the technical rigor while honoring the original thesis.  
   DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17593568

3. thesis-original-2000.pdf  
   Eduardo Hernández Morales’s professional thesis, presented at Instituto Tecnológico de Morelia in 2000. It introduces early spectral bounds for interval matrices and lays the groundwork for the hdzme001d formulation.  
   DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17593331

These documents collectively represent the origin, evolution, and validation of a robust stability criterion with lasting impact in control theory.
